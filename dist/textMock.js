    3 cups water
    
    2 #carrots
    
    1/4 white cabbage (approx. 1 cup)
    
    4 kale leaves
    
    1 broccoli head
    
    2 beetroot, cooked
    
    1 package (200g) firm tofu
    
    1/3 cup pomegranate seeds
    
    1 bunch chives
    
    1/2 cup packed mint leaves
    
    1/2 cup packed #cilantro
    
    1 avocado
    
    salt and pepper to taste
    
    For the dressing:
    
    the juice of 2 lemons
    
    3-4 garlic cloves, diced
    
    1/3 cup tahini
    
    1/4 cup tamari, or soy sauce
    
    2 tbsp apple cider vinegar,  or more lemon juice
    
    1 tbsp olive oil
    
    pinch #cumin

    Begin by cooking your quinoa. Place 1.5 cups quinoa and 3 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked. Remove from stovetop and place in a large mixing bowl to cool.
    
    Peel and grate your carrots. Remove the stems from your kale leaves and discard. Finely chop kale leaves and cabbage. Remove skin from cooked beetroot and discard, then cut beets into bite sized cubes. Remove the stem of your broccoli and discard, and finely chop the florets. 
    Add all your chopped veg to your quinoa bowl, and season with sea salt and pepper. Cut tofu into bite sized cubes and add. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and toss to combine.
    
    Make your dressing by adding lemon juice, diced garlic, tahini, tamari, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, cumin and ginger to a jar. Secure with lid and shake to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
    Pour dressing over your quinoa bowl and mix to combine. Finely chop chives, cilantro and mint and sprinkle over the salad. Toss gently to combine. Season quinoa salad with more salt and pepper to taste and serve.
